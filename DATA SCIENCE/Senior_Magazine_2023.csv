She was an excellent form teacher throughout the last two years and it's a shame to not see her after i graduate","Mrs Parker - she was always very helpful and was always patient with me when i had to ask questions, she was very kind to me throughout my time at methods and understood when students needed breaks. She was very understanding of her students and used that to make class time more efficient.

Mrs Brackin - she always helped me with my ideas whenever i needed help, i never felt uncomfortable asking her any questions as she made my ideas sound smart and encouraged me to work harder. I always loved talking to Mrs Brackin and enjoyed her classes.

Mr Thiedecke - Although i never really asked Mr Thiedecke for any help or if he could help me understand something, he was very adamant on offering his assistance at any given point. I will always appreciate sir's commitment to his students.

Mrs Wright - She was incredible throughout my time in Religion and Ethics. Although every teacher i've had was kind, she was certainly the nicest. Whenever i had questions to ask she would always jump to answer it. If there were any ideas that i'd tell her, she would always praise me even if its bad and give me fair criticisms on my work. She was always so kind to her students even when they were being difficult and was very patient throughout the two years. She is definitely one of the best teachers in the school because of her dedication to her students and involvement in their studies.

Mr Coke - I've only had Mr Coke for a year and a bit but he is one of the funniest teachers ive had, he would always crack a funny joke each lesson and really made the classes fun to be in. He was able to relate to the students humour and always made me laugh. Although my dedication to the class was sub-par, he is excellent at provided helpful feedback for my assignments or exams, and always helped me when i needed it.

Mrs Wyatt - Mrs Wyatt has been an incredible teacher and role model for me throughout my last two years, she was always very nice to talk to, about school work or just talking about her kids, the students, etc. Shes one of the only teachers i consider my friend and role model, whenever I've had an issue or something that is pressing on me I would always tell her before anyone else and she would always talk me through it and help me feel better. Mrs Wyatt is one of the greatest teachers at st peters and was an amazing role model for me throughout my last two years.

To be honest all of my teachers were incredible these past two years. Its gonna be sad to graduate cause they all made my last two years very enjoyable."

Your calmness in dealing with me freaking out over minor inconveniences is something I wish to inculcate in my life in the future :). Also Kylie Minogue is awesome. 

Mrs Treschman - Thank you for being one of the most impactful people in my schooling life thus far, having made massive blunders in my IB journey it was always good to have a role model like you who would look for the positives in the bad times :)

Mme Cassard - Having come into IB French without even knowing Passe Compose, it's quite pleasant in retrospect to look at how far I've come and it can all be attributed to your determination and motivation to see all your students succeed. Thanks for always believing in me even when i definitely didn't and for tolerating a million essays about French :)
Ms Kaur - thank you ever so much for all your support in maths. 

Mrs Liveris - thanks for being one of the most fun and engaging teachers I've come across, it's always been one of my favourite subjects but being able to do well in it thanks to you was a new height i did not think i would reach. Thanks for taking time out of your own day to ensure that I understood topics or even sitting with me to answer question meant more to me than words. 

Mr Fitzgerald- thanks for all the wonderful english texts you've taught and help me grow with.

I cannot believe I am nearing the end of my high school journey...It feels like yesterday I came into grade 10. Time sure does fly~ I just want you to know that you have been such a patient and fun form teacher. 
I can tell the care and effort you pour into us and I could not be more grateful. I, along with the rest of the class, appreciate that you actually understand us and work with us to make form the best possible time. I hope we weren't too annoying for the most part (although the competitive nature of Pictionary can't be helped).
I am sure you have received countless of thank you cards and messages over the years, you being such a wonderful teacher. I just hope you can feel the genuine gratefulness of my message. 
Every time I go to lunch after form class, my friends and I leave with big smiles on our faces (not just because it is lunchtime) because we were happy and had fun in form class. At first, I thought it was a natural thing...for form classes to be fun and interactive. However, as I talked to my friends from different classes, I realised it wasn't as common of a case. While others walked in and out of their form class with unenthusiasm and a stream of complaints, my friends and I skipped happily in and out. 
I don't think us, as a class, has really shown our appreciation much. That, is something I do regret. If I were to go back in time, I would've liked to just remind you that I was grateful to be able to be your student. 
Thank you for the laughs and memories.
